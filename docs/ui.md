# Space Models - UI Functionality Tutorial

Welcome to the **Space Models** project! This tutorial will guide you through the user interface (UI) functionalities of the program, using a set of animated GIFs for visual reference.


## Files Overview

The following GIFs have been provided to demonstrate the key functions of the **Space Models** program. Each GIF corresponds to an important aspect of the program’s UI:

1. **GA.gif**: Demonstrating the general model selection process.
2. **MQ.gif**: Showing the user interface for model quality adjustments.
3. **PW.gif**: Explaining how to manipulate the model workspace.
4. **Resample.gif**: Illustrating the resampling feature within the program.
5. **LDW.gif**: Showing the layout and workspace switching options.
6. **project.gif**: Walkthrough of loading and saving projects.
7. **Regress.gif**: Displaying the regression analysis feature of the program.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. **Model Selection and Navigation (GA.gif)**
This section demonstrates how to navigate through the available models and select the one that best fits your project needs. The interface allows you to easily browse and select models through a user-friendly dropdown list.

### 2. **Model Quality Adjustments (MQ.gif)**
Here, you’ll see how to adjust the quality settings of the models. This feature enables you to tweak various parameters, including resolution and texture quality, to fit your specific project requirements.

### 3. **Manipulating the Workspace (PW.gif)**
In this step, we demonstrate how to manipulate the model workspace. You’ll learn how to move, rotate, and scale models within the interface to achieve the desired view and positioning for your project.

### 4. **Resampling Models (Resample.gif)**
This feature allows you to resample your model’s data to change its resolution or detail. It’s particularly useful for optimizing performance or making the model more suitable for rendering or analysis.

### 5. **Layout and Workspace Switching (LDW.gif)**
Learn how to switch between different layout modes and workspaces. This will help you quickly adjust the environment depending on the task you’re performing, such as viewing models in different perspectives or managing multiple model views at once.

### 6. **Loading and Saving Projects (project.gif)**
This GIF shows how to load a previously saved project and how to save your current work. The interface supports project management, ensuring that your work is preserved and easily accessible for future sessions.

### 7. **Regression Analysis (Regress.gif)**
Watch how the regression analysis feature works, allowing you to run statistical models on the data and visualize the results directly in the UI. This is an advanced feature that helps with data-driven model refinement and analysis.
